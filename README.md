## How to Run the Project

### Backend Setup

#### Using Air (Development with Live Reload)
`Air` is a tool for live reloading during Go development. To use Air:
1. Install Air globally:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
   ```
   For more details on installation, visit the official [Air GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air).

2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
3. Initialize Air (if not already initialized):
   ```bash
   air init
   ```
4. Run the server with Air:
   ```bash
   air
   ```

#### Without Air
To run the server manually:
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Run the server directly:
   ```bash
